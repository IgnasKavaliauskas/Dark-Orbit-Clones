# League of Pilots - [[Preview]](https://youtu.be/UAbt4RkJiYs)
# Description
This project is abandoned for unknown reasons.

It may be interesting to use it for educational purpose for checking out the server structure and everything else behind the scences!

First time that I'd developed a game from scratch!

# Requirments
* Game Maker 8.0 Pro / 8.1 Pro

# How to get started
* Open the .gmk files using Game Maker and compile it! It's probably ready to be used.
