# Orbit Legacy v8.14.1 - [[Preview]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGQEYC9nDEM)
# Description
Final version, this project is abandoned and won't be updated anymore. I don't recommend using it as a base for your game since the code, the game engine and all used librarys are outdated, but I won't hinder you by doing that ;)
It may be interesting to use it for educational purpose for checking out the server structure and everything else behind the scences! (Even if it was poorly coded, it managed to hold up to 100 players in a playable state)

I've took over the development for this game after it got discontinued by the real developer in ~2012, so this repository is mainly used as a reference for myself.

# Requirments
* Game Maker 8.0 Pro / 8.1 Pro

# How to get started
* Open the .gmk files using Game Maker and compile it! It's ready to be used.
* You can modify the server address like IP/Port inside Settings.ini (This file will be auto-generated once the client was started for the first time)
* Run the server before you run the client!
