# Orbit Legacy Reloaded
# Description
This project is abandoned because at the end it was a big mix of code not following any standarts and it wasn't fun to work on it anymore!

It may be interesting to use it for educational purpose for checking out the server structure and everything else behind the scences!

This is the project I've learned the most fundementals about programming and the game engine.

# Requirments
* Game Maker 8.0 Pro / 8.1 Pro

# How to get started
* Open the .gmk files using Game Maker and compile it! It's probably ready to be used.
