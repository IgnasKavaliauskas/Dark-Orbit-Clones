# Dark-Orbit-Clones
This repository contains my relevant projects which I've created during my exploration of programming, back when I was 15+ years old.

I've experimented a lot with the source files and learned a lot during the time. Everything provided here is outdated like the game engine, the used librarys and the code, since it was developed in my first phases of learning programming. That said, I'm not recommending using it as a base for your project but it's nice to take a look how things were made.

# The most relevant things I've learned
* Basic programming knowledge and advanced knowledge for the built-in scripting language GML
* Advanced understanding for the Game Maker engine and everything related to it
* Networking for real-time multiplayer games including client side prediction
* Databases (MySQL). The game has initialy used .ini files to store data but I've replaced it with MySQL because it has suited my needs much more and I was able to create a Website which was connected to the DB.
* Webdevelopment using jQuery, PHP, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap.
* How to interact with your players and the passion for managing and developing a game
* Also the interest for UI/UX design.
* Working in a team
* .. and more


# About the different clones

[Orbit Legacy Reloaded](https://github.com/ignaskavaliauskas/Dark-Orbit-Clones/tree/master/Orbit%20Legacy%20Reloaded) was more or less the most alive project, it gone through different development cicles, lot of code revamps because I was everytime learning new things and I wanted to apply my new knowledge into the game which improved the games quality a lot. 


[League of Pilots](https://github.com/ignaskavaliauskas/Dark-Orbit-Clones/tree/master/League%20of%20Pilots) was my first project which I've started from scratch, based on my knowledge and ofcourse my own code! It was a big step for myself since I was always using the source code of the original game as a base, which was poorly coded which I realized later. The code was so much cleaner and it was much more fun working on this new code base. Sadly I've never published it and I don't remember the reason for that, maybe I'll pick this project up again.. someday..

[Orbit Legacy 8.14.1](https://github.com/ignaskavaliauskas/Dark-Orbit-Clones/tree/master/Orbit%20Legacy%208.14.1) was the first open-source project I had. I saw a lot of developers still using the old and poorly coded / optimized game and my intention was to provide everyone a much better starting point, it was still based the original game but I've re-written a lot of things and improved existing code. Fixed a lot of bugs, made the game more secure and much more stable.
