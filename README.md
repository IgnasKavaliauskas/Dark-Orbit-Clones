# Dark-Orbit-Clones
This repository contains my relevant projects which I've created during my exploration of programming, back when I was 15 years old.

I've experimented a lot with the source files and learned a lot during the time. 
# The most relevant things I've learned
* Basic programming knowledge
* Advanced understanding for the Game Maker engine and everything related to it
* Networking for real-time multiplayer games including client side prediction
* Databases (MySQL). The game has initialy used .ini files to store data but I've replaced it with MySQL because it has suited my needs much more and I was able to create a Website which was connected to the DB.
* Webdevelopment using jQuery, PHP, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap.
* How to interact with your players and the passion for managing and developing a game
* Also the interest for UI/UX design.
* Working in a team


# About the different clones

[Orbit Legacy Reloaded](https://github.com/ignaskavaliauskas/Dark-Orbit-Clones/tree/master/Orbit%20Legacy%20Reloaded) was more or less the most alive project, it gone through different development cicles, lot of code revamps because I was everytime learning new things and I wanted to apply my new knowledge into the game which improved the games quality a lot. 


[League of Pilots](https://github.com/ignaskavaliauskas/Dark-Orbit-Clones/tree/master/League%20of%20Pilots) was my first project which I've started from scratch, based on my knowledge and ofcourse my own code! It was a big step for myself since I was always using the source code of the original game as a base, which was poorly coded which I realized later. The code was so much cleaner and it was much more fun working on this new code base. Sadly I've never published it and I don't remember the reason for that, maybe I'll pick this project up again.. someday..

[Orbit Legacy 8.14.1](https://github.com/ignaskavaliauskas/Dark-Orbit-Clones/tree/master/Orbit%20Legacy%208.14.1) was the first open-source project I had. I saw a lot of developers still using the old and poorly coded / optimized game and my intention was to provide everyone a much better starting point, it was still based the original game but I've re-written a lot of things and improved existing code. Fixed a lot of bugs, made the game more secure and much more stable.
